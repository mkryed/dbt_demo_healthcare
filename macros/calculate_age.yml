  - name: calculate_age
    description: >
      This macros calculates the age in years based on a given date using the date_diff
      function. The macros takes in two arguments patient_birth_date and date_2 (optional) -
      the end date to calculate patient's age (e.g. date of decease, date of assigning a condition),
      with the current date as default. If only patient_birth_date is provided, the patient's current
      age is calculated (as of today). If date_2 is provided, the patient's age at the specified date is calculated.
    arguments:
      - name: patient_birth_date
        type: string
        description: This date represents the date of birth.
      - name: date_2
        type: string
        description: >
          By default, this argument is not provided, and it defaults to the current date. Overriding this
          argument allows calculating the age of individuals at a specific date, such as deceased patients.
